         conversation. You keep repeating the same information!

SOLUTION: This app:
  ✓ Saves your conversations automatically
  ✓ Extracts important information (projects, tasks, dates, budgets)
  ✓ Generates smart prompts with FULL CONTEXT
  ✓ Organizes everything by PROJECT/WORKSPACE
  ✓ Shows you what AI "remembers" and "thinks"
