PART 1: WHAT IS THIS APP?

AI Context Manager Pro solves a big problem:

PROBLEM: AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) forget everything after each 
         conversation. You keep repeating the same information!

SOLUTION: This app:
  * Saves your conversations automatically
  * Extracts important information (projects, tasks, dates, budgets)
  * Generates smart prompts with FULL CONTEXT
  * Organizes everything by PROJECT/WORKSPACE
  * Shows you what AI "remembers" and "thinks"
